## Selected System Overview

Goal: seamless digital identification of stolen bicycles.

- Seamless digital identification of bicycles.
- Embedded RFID tags or engraved barcodes in bicycle frames instead of engraved frame numbers which are hard to read.
- Mobile app for reporting stolen bicycles and letting the public scan bicycles to identify the stolen ones.
- Bounty-hunter program on the app to empower common people and help recover stolen bicycles.

## System Goals

1. More people store the unique identifier of their bicycles
2. Transfers of ownership should be (veritably) stored
3. In case of theft, more people report their bicycle as stolen
4. More bicycles are scanned and looked up in the database of stolen bicycles

## Solution Direction

- **Streamline Bicycle Registration and Ownership Transfer:** Simplify the process for registering bicycles and transferring ownership, ensuring quick and seamless updates in the system with accurate record-keeping.
- **Enhance Theft Reporting and Recovery:** Implement a simple and user-friendly theft reporting system, allowing users to report stolen bicycles and the related information on the app.
- **Boost Scanning Efficiency for Identifying Bicycles:** Ensure faster and more accurate matching of RFID tags and frame numbers to the owner, enhancing the likelihood of recovery.
- **Design for Wide Audience Adoption:** Focus on an intuitive, user-friendly interface that caters to a broad range of users, including those with minimal technical experience. Prioritize ease of use, accessibility, and a seamless experience to encourage widespread adoption.

## Proof of Concept Ideas

- Prototype RFID tag integrated in bicycle frame.
- Demo mobile app for scanning and theft reporting.
- Simulated database for stolen bicycle lookups.
- Mock-up of reward system interface.
