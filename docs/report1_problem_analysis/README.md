|                         | **Level 1 -- Outstanding (3 points)**                                       | **Level 2 -- Good (2 points)**                                           | **Level 3 -- Weak (1 point)**                                               | **Level 4 -- Missing (No points)**                        |

| **Problem description rigor**   | Compelling, coherent analysis of a convincing and challenging problem         | Adequate analysis of a problem relevant to software architecture         | Little value added by the problem description to what is already known      | Overall report weak and unconvincing                       |
| **Use of domain analysis techniques** | Exemplary and in depth use of range of analysis techniques covered in course and in literature. Clear which techniques were chosen (with references) and why, and how they contribute to overall story | Adequate use of relevant analysis techniques                              | Superficial use of domain analysis techniques that adds little value        | The report shows very little evidence of engagement with material as discussed in course |
| **Model quality**        | Relevant models (e.g., context, domain class / interaction diagrams) and diagrams, well integrated in the text, used to illustrate key points. | Good models, but only weakly connected to the main storyline             | Few or superficial models, that add little to the overall story             | No models                                                  |
| **Writing clarity**      | Clear and carefully worded writing with authentic tone and coherent paragraphs; adequate use of references in application domain or software architecture literature | Clear and professional writing, but not very engaging. Indicator can be overuse of series of bullet points with insufficient connections. | Adequate writing with mostly correct sentences, but with insufficient connections between paragraphs and insufficient coherence within paragraphs. | Sloppy writing with mistakes in e.g. grammar or formatting. |
